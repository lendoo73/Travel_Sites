# [Travel Sites](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-flask/projects/flask-accounts-authentication)

Travel is one of the great pleasures of life.

In this project you will create an application that gives visitors the ability to create accounts and authenticate in order to post about and view locations of travel and descriptions about them.

The application begins as a working “Hello World” endpoint built with Flask and contains a SQLAlchemy database. The third party modules we’ll use are:

* Flask SQLAlchemy
* Flask-Login
* Flask-WTF

We will use these modules to create our application featuring the ability for users to create accounts and authenticate in order to post travel destinations.
